SUMMARY:
MSP Diesel Solutions is partnering with Prometheus Agency to design, develop, and deploy a Route Management Application. This mobile-friendly web application will connect directly with HubSpot CRM to help field sales representatives plan, execute, and log customer visits with greater accuracy and efficiency.
The application will:
Integrate bi-directionally with HubSpot CRM
Identify nearby accounts through GPS or a specified city
Generate optimized travel routes using AI logic

OBJECTIVES:
Empower field sales representatives with a map-based interface that recommends optimal routes and simplifies daily planning.
Improve data accuracy through automated, location-verified activity logging in HubSpot.
Increase leadership visibility into territory coverage and visit frequency.
Maximize ROI on HubSpot by leveraging existing CRM data for real-time decision-making.

REQUIRED INVESTMENT
The Route Management Application will be developed under a one-time setup fee of $15,000, which includes requirements definition, UI/UX design, development, rollout, and training.
Following launch, ongoing costs will consist solely of monthly usage and hosting fees, which are anticipated to range between $40 and $60 per month, depending on API activity and user volume.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY & LICENSING: 
These ownership and licensing terms are designed to protect Prometheus’s reusable intellectual property while ensuring MSP retains full control and commercial benefit from its custom-built platform and data.

Ownership of Core Platform IP
All proprietary software, libraries, code, AI agents, orchestration frameworks, models, prompt logic, workflows, templates, and integration structures developed or used by Prometheus (collectively, the “Prometheus Platform”) are and shall remain the exclusive property of Prometheus Agency, LLC.
Nothing in this Scope of Work grants or conveys ownership of the Prometheus Platform, its source code, or derivative works to the Client.
Client Deliverables and Use Rights
Upon completion and acceptance of the deliverables, MSP is granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable, perpetual license to use the delivered software and its custom configuration for internal business operations.
This license includes full access to the features, dashboards, and workflows described in this SOW, and ownership of all Client Data, including records, reports, media, and configurations generated through system use.
The license does not include ownership of the Prometheus Platform source code, AI orchestration logic, or any reusable core component.
Hosting, Support, and Usage
Future enhancements will be scoped via Change Order. Hosting, licensing, and AI token usage will be governed separately under a Licensing & Usage Agreement.
The software and AI services will be hosted within Prometheus’s managed cloud environment.
Continued access to hosted AI features, API connections, and model orchestration requires an active Licensing & Usage Agreement.
If that agreement lapses or is terminated, access to hosted components will be suspended, though Client Data remains exportable for a 60-day period following termination, as defined in the Licensing & Platform Services Agreement.
Hosting and support fees are not included in this SOW and will be governed separately via a change order. Hosting and support fees, including token costs, are subject to change based on variable changes in model costs and overall product evolution.
Data Ownership and Use
All data provided by MSP or generated through its operations—including technician reports, images, voice transcripts, and performance metrics (“Client Data”)—remains the exclusive property of MSP.
Prometheus may process and temporarily use Client Data solely to train, fine-tune, or optimize AI models deployed for MSP’s individual environment (the “Client Model”).
Prometheus will not use, share, or commingle Client Data to train or enhance models for any other client or commercial product without MSP’s written consent.
Data Security and Continuity
Prometheus will maintain commercially reasonable data security and confidentiality standards.
If the relationship between the parties ends, Prometheus will provide MSP with an export of all Client Data and the trained model parameters derived from that data. MSP may retain and reuse these model parameters within its own environment for internal purposes, independent of Prometheus’s platform.
The Prometheus orchestration framework, agents, and supporting infrastructure are not transferable and will not be included in this export.
Derivative Works and Improvements
Any derivative works, updates, or enhancements to the Prometheus Platform created during or after this engagement remain the sole property of Prometheus.
Client-specific configurations, branding, and workflows are licensed for internal use but may not be redistributed or sublicensed.

Prometheus retains underlying intellectual property rights in the codebase, frameworks, and development patterns used to build the application, and may reuse or adapt such elements for other projects, provided no Client Data or proprietary business logic unique to MSP is disclosed.

MSP may export and redeploy the delivered application independently; however, Prometheus retains intellectual property rights in reusable code, architecture patterns, and framework logic used to build it.
